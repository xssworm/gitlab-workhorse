v0.8.5

Simplify revspec for 'git format-patch'.

v0.8.4

Fix Go 1.5 compatibility broken in 0.8.3. Update CI configuration so
that tests run on Go 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 (was only 1.6 before).

v0.8.3

Add rate-limiting feature for /api requests (disabled by default).
Suppress non-zero exit code error from git-upload-pack during shallow
Git clone (only affects logging and Sentry). Don't treat EEXIST as an
error during git archive finalization.

v0.8.2

Recognize more archive formats in git.SendArchive. Make 502 errors
(failed proxy requests to Unicorn) easier to recognize in Sentry.

v0.8.1

Add Sentry (raven-go) for remote error tracking.

v0.8.0

Add JWT signed communication between gitlab-workhorse and gitlab-rails.

v0.7.11

Fix 'nil dereference' crash on Go 1.7 when parsing authBackend
parameter. Fix 'hard-wire backend host' crashes.

v0.7.10

Fix typo in metrics header name.

v0.7.9

Hard-wire backend host when using TCP.

v0.7.8

Send artifact zip file entries via the 'senddata' mechanism.

v0.7.7

Add the protocol used (HTTP) to each gitCommand call in order to check
for restricted protocol access on GitLab's side.

v0.7.6

Add the capability to inject `git format-patch` output.

v0.7.5

Add the capability to inject `git diff` output as HTTP response bodies
(@zj).

v0.7.4

Pass a timestamp when forwarding requests to Rails. Hopefully this
will give us insight into Unicorn queueing behavior.

v0.7.3

Revert 'buffer Git HTTP responses'. Set default listen socket
permissions to world read/writeable.

v0.7.2 DO NOT USE

Integrate with GOPATH during development (remove relative imports
etc.). Buffer Git HTTP responses so that we may return an error if the
local command fails early.

Update: the 'buffer Git HTTP responses' change in 0.7.2 is BAD, it
breaks shallow Git clone. Don't use 0.7.2!

v0.7.1

Set Content-Length (retrieved from Git) on raw blob data responses.

v0.7.0

Start using a 'v' prefix on the version string.

0.6.5

Inject 'git archive' data the same way as Git blob data.

0.6.4

Increase default ProxyHeadersTimeout to 5 minutes. Fix injecting raw
blobs for /api/v3 requetsts.

0.6.3

Add support for sending Git raw git blobs via gitlab-workhorse.

0.6.2

We now fill in missing directory entries in archize zip metadata
files; also some other minor changes.

0.6.1

Add support for generating zip artifacts metadata and serving single
files from zip archives.

Gitlab-workhorse now consists of multiple executables. We also fixed a
routing bug introduced by the 0.6.0 refactor that broke relative URL
support.

0.6.0

Overhauled the source code organization; no user-facing changes
(intended). The application code is now split into Go 'packages'
(modules). As of 0.6.0 gitlab-workhorse requires Go 1.5 or newer.

0.5.4

Fix /api/v3/projects routing bug introduced in 0.5.2-0.5.3.

0.5.3

Fixes merge error in 0.5.2.

0.5.2 (broken!)

- Always check with upstream if files in /uploads/ may be served
- Fix project%2Fnamespace API project ID's
- Prevent archive zombies when using gzip or bzip2
- Don't show pretty error pages in development mode

0.5.1

Deprecate -relativeURLRoot option, use -authBackend instead.

0.5.0

Send ALL GitLab requests through gitlab-workhorse.

0.4.2

Return response to client when uploading Git LFS object.

0.4.1

Add support for Build Artifacts and Git LFS. The GitLab-Workhorse
offloads file uploading and downloading by providing support for
rewriting multipart form data and X-Sendfile.

Other changes:
- add header Gitlab-Workhorse to all requests to indicate from where
  they originated

0.4.0

Rename the project to gitlab-workhorse. The old name had become too
specific.

Other changes:

- pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH to Git commands
- accomodate broken HTTP clients by spelling 'Www-Authenticate' as
  'WWW-Authenticate'

0.3.1

Add support for Unix domain socket connections to the authBackend.

0.3.0

In 0.3.0 we also handle 'git archive' downloads for GitLab 8.1+.
This has lead to some breaking API changes, making 0.3.0 incompatible
with GitLab 8.0.  We now expect the 'auth backend' (GitLab) to
provide us with much more information about each request, such as
the path on disk to the Git repository the client is requesting.
This makes the REPO_ROOT command line argument obsolete.

0.2.14

This is the last version that works with GitLab 8.0.
